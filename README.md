# Joshua's dot-files

This repository contains all of my configuration files. You may notice that none of the files are actually "dot" files in that
they do not start with a '.'. This is to make them non-hidden files.

Forked from Buck's dotfiles: https://github.com/b-ryan/dotfiles

Thanks also to: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles and https://github.com/timvisher

## Installation

Just run

```bash
./install.sh
```

It will create symlinks for all the dot-files in your home directory. It will
overwrte files wherever it tries to install stuff, but will back everything
up into the .bk directory.
